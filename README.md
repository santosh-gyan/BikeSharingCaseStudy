## Conclusions
1> Most of the rentals are for commuting to workshops and colleges on a daily basis. should launch more stations near these landmarks to reach out to their main customers. 2> peak rental hours, i.e., 7–9 am and 5–6 pm. 3> Price should bebased on seasonal variations to promote bike usage during the fall and winter seasons. 4> Due to the low usage of bikes at night, it would be better to do bike maintenance at night. Removing some bikes from the streets at night time will not cause trouble for the customers.
